## Database Model
![Crude Oil-rye](https://github.com/kobertlam/Energy_ETF_RYE_Forecast/blob/database/Resources/Oil%20Price_%20RYE%20ERD.png)  
We've decided to use SQL, and the ERD was created based on the datasets below:
1. brent_spot_price_crude_oil
* Primary key: date
2. RYE.csv
* Foreign key: date
