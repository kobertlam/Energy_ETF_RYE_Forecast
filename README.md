We've decided to use SQL, and the ERD was created based on the datasets below:
1. brent_spot_price_crude_oil
* Primary key: date
2. nasdaq_screener
* Primary key: ticker
3. Top 10 oil companies historical stock price
* Foreign Key: date
* Foreign Key: ticker
  
Note: Table 11 and 12 are not displayed with full information due to the limitation of free version QuickDBD.
