# Energy ETF RYE Forecast

This is the final project for Data Analytics Bootcamp for our group (Group 4). We have integrated the data analystic skills and tools we have learnt from the bootcamp into this final project.

We aim to, based on the crude oil price and ETF price, forecast the future value of an Energy ETF price (Invesco S&P 500Â® Equal Weight Energy ETF).

## Presentation

We prepared a [Google Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M9gE1Wv08GLSOgKtwCtLHypvGdmYd1BzGTxuklBDWRo/edit?usp=sharing) for presentation purpose.

## Purpose of this Project

### Background

Brent crude spot price jumped to $133 a barrel on March 8, 2022 and it represents the highest oil prices since 2008. Oil companies supply billions of barrels of petroleum products daily to power transportation and industry. The fluctuation of the crude oil price has direct impact on the production cost of the carbon-based fuels and products, which in turn impacting the profitability and the stock prices of the oil companies. In this project, we would like bring insights to fund managers and investors who are interested in investing the oil-related sector. We will study if there is any relationship between the crude oil price and the Energy ETF (RYE).

### Questions to be Answered

1. Are there seasonal trends and patterns on the Energy ETF? Can we forecast the future ETF prices solely based on the historical ETF prices (time series)?
2. Is there any relationship between the crude oil prices and the ETF prices? Can we forecast the future ETF price based on both the historical ETF prices and the historical crude oil prices?

### Benefits

The value investment theories indicate that the market/nominal stock value of any company tends to approach the real value. If a stock is under-valued for now, the stock price tends to increase. If a stock is over-valued for now, the stock price is likely to decrease over time. 

If we are able to determine the relationship between the stock prices of the oil companies and the crude oil prices, investors or fund managers will be able to make better decisions when analyzing the stock market. 

### Team Collaboration - Communication Protocols

* We created a private group chat in `Slack` as the primary communication channel within the team.
* We also used Zoom meeting for group collaboration.

## Data Source

## Machine Learning Models

## Database

## Dashboard

We export the data from [`master.ipynb`](../main/master.ipynb) into CSV files, and then import the CSV files into **Tablueau Public** to create interactive dashboard.
The data of the predicted RYE prices come from the results of the neural networks models.

Here is the outline of the dashboard:

![Dashboard Blueprint1](../presentation/Resources/RYE_Portfolio.png)
![Dashboard Blueprint2](../presentation/Resources/Time-Series.png)

The dashboard will include the following viz:
1. A Heatmap for Energy ETF (RYE) portfolio breakdown
2. A bar chart showing the market value of the individual company within RYE
3. A time-series plot showing both the Brent crude oil price and RYE price
4. A time-series plot showing the seasonal changes on oil and RYE price
5. A time-series plot showing the historical and future price of RYE for the next day, next 3 or 5 days

The interactive elements:
* There will be a linkage between the heatmap and bar chart, so that user can filter the data by **Sector**, and both charts will be updated based on the selected Sector
* User can select different prediction of RYE prices for the next day, next 3 days, or next 5 days
