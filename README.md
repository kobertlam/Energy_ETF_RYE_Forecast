# Introduction
This is the final project for Data Analytics Bootcamp (Group 4). We integrated the data analystic skills and tools we learnt from the bootcamp into this final project.

## Objective
* **Topic:** Predicting the stock prices for a portfolio of the top 10 oil companies trading in U.S. based on the crude oil price.
* Brent crude spot price jumped to $133 a barrel on 8 March 2022 represents the highest oil prices since 2008.  Oil companies supply billions of barrels of petroleum products daily to power transportation and industry.  The fluctuation of the crude oil price has direct impact on the production cost of the carbon-based fuels and products, which in turn impacting the profitability and the stock prices of the oil companies.  In this project, we would like bring insights to fund managers and investors who are interested in investing the oil-related sector.  We will study if there is any relationship between the crude oil price and the stock prices of the top 10 oil companies trading in U.S.  Ideally, we may suggest if the portfolio is currently under-valued or over-valued for investing, and also the trend in the future.
